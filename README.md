Sure, I'll modify the "Signals generated" point to be more concise:

- Project: Real-time stock prediction and signal generation
- Main objective: Implement a system for generating real-time trading signals
- Strategy used: Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crossover
- Signals generated: Buy and Sell
- Data source: yfinance library for stock price data
- Visualization: Gradio application to display buy and sell signals
